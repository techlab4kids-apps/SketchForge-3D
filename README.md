## Why SketchForge

SketchForge is a lightweight CAD-style workspace for people who want to sketch, cut, and export 3D models quickly.

It is built for the satisfying loop: drop a shape, resize it, rotate it, make another shape a hole, group the result, import an STL if primitives are not enough, and export the finished model.

No login. No server project storage. No heavyweight CAD install just to make a useful part.

## What It Does

- **Local-first projects** - designs live in browser storage with generated project thumbnails.
- **Real 3D workplane** - grid, camera controls, snap settings, transform handles, outlines, and inspector controls.
- **Primitive shape library** - boxes, cylinders, spheres, cones, pyramids, wedges, text, roofs, half spheres, torus shapes, tubes, and more.
- **Solid and hole workflow** - turn shapes into cutters and group them into final geometry.
- **Boolean Intersection** - keep only the geometry where selected solid and hole shapes overlap.
- **Reversible edge tools** - chamfer and fillet selected CAD edges, with history controls for removing applied edge features.
- **Rotated solid edge treatment** - chamfer and fillet preserve analytic box topology after one-, two-, or three-axis rotations.
- **STL import** - bring outside models into the same workspace as primitives.
- **STL, OBJ, and STEP workflows** - export selected objects or the whole scene, and round-trip exact STEP/B-Rep geometry.
- **Fast browser stack** - Next.js, React, TypeScript, Three.js, and Manifold/CSG geometry tooling.

## Getting Started

There are two common ways to run SketchForge. If you are not sure which one to choose, use Docker.

| Path | Best for | Difficulty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker / FabLab server | Teachers, classrooms, shared computers, local network hosting | Recommended |
| Local development | Developers who want to edit the code | Medium |

SketchForge is local-first in both modes. The app files may be served from a computer or server, but projects stay in each user's browser storage. STL and OBJ exports download through the user's browser. SketchForge does not upload models to a SketchForge cloud service.

## macOS Desktop Release

GitHub releases include macOS DMG files for Intel (`x64`) and Apple Silicon (`arm64`) Macs. Choose the file that matches your Mac.

1. Open the downloaded DMG file.
2. Drag `SketchForge.app` to the `Applications` folder.
3. Eject the DMG file.
4. Control-click `SketchForge.app` in `Applications`.
5. Select **Open**, then select **Open** again.

Unsigned releases have `-unsigned` in the file name. macOS shows a Gatekeeper warning for these releases. If macOS does not show the **Open** option, run this command in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SketchForge.app
open /Applications/SketchForge.app
```

Do not open the app from Safari's Downloads folder or directly from the mounted DMG. Copy it to `Applications` first.

### macOS Virtual Machines

Some macOS virtual machines do not provide hardware WebGL. Launch SketchForge with software WebGL in that case:

```bash
/Applications/SketchForge.app/Contents/MacOS/SketchForge \
  --use-angle=swiftshader \
  --enable-unsafe-swiftshader
```

### Download the Project

If you already know Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Formsmith746/SketchForge-3D.git
cd SketchForge-3D
```

If you do not know Git yet:

1. Open the GitHub page for this repository.
2. Press the green **Code** button.
3. Press **Download ZIP**.
4. Extract the ZIP somewhere easy to find, such as your Desktop.
5. Open a terminal in the extracted folder.

On Windows, you can open PowerShell in the folder by opening the folder, clicking the address bar, typing `powershell`, and pressing Enter.

## Docker / FabLab Server (Recommended)

Docker is the easiest way to run SketchForge for a classroom, workshop, or FabLab. It packages the build tools, Next.js server, health check, persistent shared-project storage, and restart behavior together.

### What You Need

- Docker Desktop on Windows or macOS, or Docker Engine on Linux
- Docker Compose, which is included with modern Docker Desktop
- This repository downloaded on the server computer

If `docker` is not recognized, install Docker Desktop and open it once before running the commands.

### Start SketchForge

#### Compose (Build images locally)

From the SketchForge project folder, run:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

The first start can take a few minutes because Docker builds the app.

#### Compose (Prebuilt)

From the SketchForge project folder or with the downloaded `deploy/docker/compose-ghcr.yaml`, run:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose-ghcr.yaml up -d
```

#### Standalone (Prebuilt)

```bash
docker run -d --name sketchforge --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_DIR=/data/projects \
  -v sketchforge-shared-projects:/data/projects \
  ghcr.io/formsmith746/sketchforge-3d:latest
```

After running, open this on the same computer:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

If that works, SketchForge is running.

The container listens on port `3000`. It also accepts connections on port `80` for backward compatibility with older UnRAID templates and forwards them to the same server. New Docker and UnRAID configurations should use container port `3000`.

### Shared Docker Projects

Docker deployments include a shared `.skf` project library. Private projects still autosave in each user's browser. The **Shared** dashboard section lists files stored in `/data/projects`, and **Export → SKF → Save to shared** writes the current project there. Revision-matched PNG previews are stored beside the library in `/data/projects/.thumbnails` and appear on shared project cards.

Compose uses the persistent `sketchforge-shared-projects` volume by default. To use a directory on the Docker host instead, set `SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_VOLUME` before starting Compose:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_VOLUME = "C:/SketchForge/shared-projects"
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_VOLUME=/srv/sketchforge-projects docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Opening a shared file creates a private local working copy. Saving back checks the server revision first; if another user has changed the file, SketchForge refuses to overwrite it and asks the user to reload or save with another name. This is shared file storage, not simultaneous live editing.

### Let Other Computers Join

Other computers on the same Wi-Fi or LAN need the server computer's local IP address.

On Windows PowerShell, run:

```powershell
ipconfig
```

Look for the `IPv4 Address`, for example:

```text
192.168.1.25
```

Then other computers can open:

```text
http://192.168.1.25:3000/
```

Use your own IP address, not the example one.

### Use a Different Port

If port `3000` is already being used, choose another port such as `8080`.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SKETCHFORGE_PORT = "8080"
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
SKETCHFORGE_PORT=8080 docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

### Stop SketchForge

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml down
```

### Update SketchForge Later

The home dashboard's **Settings** panel checks the official version and displays an update prompt when a newer version is available. It never installs an update automatically. Choosing **Not now** dismisses only that version, so a later release will be offered again.

If you used Git, update the existing checkout in place. You do not need to remove or download the repository again:

```bash
git pull
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

If you use the prebuilt GHCR Compose file:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose-ghcr.yaml pull sketchforge
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose-ghcr.yaml up -d --no-deps sketchforge
```

If you downloaded the ZIP, download the newest ZIP, extract it, and run:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Application updates do not clear private projects stored in the browser. Docker shared projects remain in the existing `sketchforge-shared-projects` volume or the host directory configured with `SKETCHFORGE_SHARED_PROJECTS_VOLUME`. Never add `--volumes` or `-v` to an update command.

For an administrator-managed one-click installation, configure all of the following server variables:

- `SKETCHFORGE_UPDATE_TRIGGER_URL`: an internal HTTPS endpoint that pulls/recreates only the SketchForge application while retaining its existing project volume.
- `SKETCHFORGE_UPDATE_ADMIN_KEY`: the key the administrator must enter in the confirmation dialog.
- `SKETCHFORGE_UPDATE_TRIGGER_TOKEN` (optional): a bearer token SketchForge sends only to the internal update service.

Without an administrator-managed trigger, the confirmation opens these safe update instructions instead of granting the web container access to the Docker socket.

### Docker Troubleshooting

- **`docker` is not recognized**: install Docker Desktop, open it, and try again.
- **Docker says the daemon is not running**: Docker Desktop is closed or still starting.
- **Port already in use**: use another port, for example `8080`.
- **Other computers cannot connect**: check that they are on the same network and that the server firewall allows the chosen port.
- **The page opens but old files appear**: stop and rebuild with `docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml down`, then `docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.yaml up --build -d`.

If you already have Node.js installed, the repository also includes shortcuts:

```bash
npm run docker:up
npm run docker:down
```

## Local Development

Use this path if you want to edit SketchForge's code.

### What You Need

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm, included with Node.js

Check your versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If those commands do not work, install Node.js from the official Node.js website and reopen your terminal.

### Install and Run

From the SketchForge project folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

Leave the terminal open while you use the app. To stop the development server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Useful Developer Commands

Run TypeScript checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Start the local SketchForge MCP bridge for editor automation:

```bash
npm run mcp:sketchforge
```

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build a static export:

```bash
npm run export
```

## Optional remote autosave

The editor keeps its existing local IndexedDB project cache. A deployment can enable the generic remote adapter by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_TL4K_AUTOSAVE_URL` at build time; when the variable is absent, the adapter is a no-op.

The endpoint receives a `POST` multipart request with `project_id`, `client_revision`, `base_revision`, `idempotency_key`, a `.skf` `project` file and an optional PNG `thumbnail`. Requests use same-origin cookies (`credentials: include`) and must return a JSON object containing the accepted server `revision`. A `409` response is terminal and preserves the queued project for explicit conflict resolution. Transient network and `408`, `425`, `429` and `5xx` failures are retried with jittered 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 30 second backoff; the pending record is persisted in IndexedDB so it can resume after a reload.

The adapter contains no TL4K session, identity, storage or database logic. The gateway is responsible for authentication, authorization and mapping the generic project identifier to the current user context.

The application exposes a **Source** link in the dashboard. Operators distributing or hosting a modified build should set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOURCE_CODE_URL` at build time to the public URL containing that build's complete corresponding source code.

## SketchForge MCP Skill

SketchForge includes a local MCP server for AI clients that support MCP tools. It lets an agent inspect and control a live local editor tab: list open editors, read the scene, create/update/select objects, group/cut/separate parts, list CAD edge ids, apply chamfer or fillet, inspect errors, and capture viewport images.

This is for local development only. Run SketchForge with `npm run dev`; the MCP route is disabled in production builds and Docker/static hosting.

### Start SketchForge for MCP

From the SketchForge project folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open an editor tab:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/?editor=1
```

The AI client starts the MCP server with:

```bash
node scripts/sketchforge-mcp-server.mjs
```

### Codex

The Codex skill is included at:

```text
docs/skills/sketchforge-mcp-skill
```

Install it into your Codex skills folder.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "docs\skills\sketchforge-mcp-skill" "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\sketchforge-mcp-skill"
```

macOS or Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R docs/skills/sketchforge-mcp-skill ~/.codex/skills/
```

Then add an MCP server entry to your Codex config. Use [`docs/mcp/codex-config.example.toml`](docs/mcp/codex-config.example.toml) as the template and replace the script path with the absolute path on your machine. Restart Codex after changing the config.

Once installed, ask Codex:

```text
Use $sketchforge-mcp-skill to list my open SketchForge editors and inspect the current scene.
```

### Claude

Claude does not use Codex `SKILL.md` files, but it can use the same SketchForge MCP server. Add the server to Claude Desktop's MCP config using [`docs/mcp/claude-desktop-config.example.json`](docs/mcp/claude-desktop-config.example.json) as the template, replacing the script path with the absolute path on your machine.

After restarting Claude Desktop, ask:

```text
Use the SketchForge MCP tools to list open editors, inspect the scene, and modify the selected object.
```

The main tool names are `sketchforge_list_editors`, `sketchforge_read_scene`, `sketchforge_list_objects`, `sketchforge_create_shape`, `sketchforge_update_object`, `sketchforge_list_edges`, `sketchforge_apply_edge_treatment`, and `sketchforge_capture_image`.
